format pioneered by Macromedia which continues to be supported by their 
successor company, Adobe. Flash has been extended to include audio and 
video content, and programs written in ActionScript, an 
ECMAScript-compatible language. Gnash is based on GameSWF, and supports 
most SWF v7 features and some SWF v8 and v9."
